# When the blazing sun is set, and the grass with dew is wet. Then you show your little
# light, twinkle, twinkle all the night. Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you
# are.
# Then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark. How could he see where to
# go if you did not twinkle so? Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are.
# As your bright and tiny spark lights the traveler in the dark, though I know not what you
# are, twinkle, twinkle, little star. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are."""
